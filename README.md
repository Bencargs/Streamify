# Streamify
Personal music streaming service


## Motivation
Annoyed how I had to pay for music streaming servies, when I own an entire music library at home.

Idea was to create a hosted service that could convert my local mp3 files into a network data stream,
and have a client call that hosted endpoint, decode and play the stream as audio.

I unimaginatively name it streamify.
